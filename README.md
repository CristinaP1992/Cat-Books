**Cat&Books**

This app is designed for book lovers. Plan and enjoy your reading!

_Getting started_

- The CAT_Books folder contains a full-stack application with two sub-folders: solo-project and server. Inside each of them, run npm install to install the required dependencies.
- To run the app use 'npm run dev'(from solo-project folder) and 'nodemon app.js'(from server folder) to run the code.
  Create a config.js file with your database url(use config.sample.js as an example). Both the solo-project and the server need to be running for the application to work.

_Back end_

On the back end I used Express and MongoDB(Mongoose).

_Front end_

On the back end I used React and Vanilla CSS.
